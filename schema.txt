NEEDED HARDWARE:
for the Theremin:
- 1 ATTiny 25/45/85/25V/45V/85V Microcontroller (I used an ATTiny45, but all others should work as well)
- 1 HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement module
- 1 piezo speaker (normal speaker might work as well if used with a resistor. make shure that that the load on each ATTiny pin is below 40mA)
- some wires, breadboard or PCB

for programming:
- 1 AVR ISP (in system programmer). I use an mySmartUSB light, which is not the most reliable but usually works. If you use something different, change the Makefile accordingly.
- possibility to attach the ISP to the board. I have cutted an old Floppy Drive Cable
- for debugging: an UART level converter (I use a selfmade based on the MAX232)




WIREING:
                    ┌───_───┐
     [RESET]    B5 ─┤ 1   8 ├─ VCC
                    │       │
ECHO  (PCINT3)  B3 ─┤ 2   7 ├─ B2  TRIGGER
                    │       │
Send            B4 ─┤ 3   6 ├─ B1  ( OC1A)  POSOUT
                    │       │
               GND ─┤ 4   5 ├─ B0  (/OC1A)  NEGOUT
                    └───────┘




upside down:

                     ┌───────┐
NEGOUT  (/OC1A)  B0 ─┤ 5   4 ├─ GND
                     │       │
POSOUT  ( OC1A)  B1 ─┤ 6   3 ├─ B4  Send
                     │       │
TRIGGER          B2 ─┤ 7   2 ├─ B3  (PCINT3)  ECHO
                     │       │
                VCC ─┤ 8 _ 1 ├─ B5  [RESET]
                     └─── ───┘

ECHO interferes with ISP, if connected to anything else than B3 or B4: no program transmission possible otherwise


Timer/Counter0 has this prescaler: 1, 8, 64, 256, 1024
Timer/Counter1 has many prescaler: 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 16384
-> use this for TONE, as one prescaler step equals one octave

ECHO: TimerCounter0
TONE: TimerCounter1


NOTES:
something about playing notes:
http://www.technoblogy.com/show?KVO

for serial communication: 'sudo moserial'


ideas for further improvement:
*if you need more ports for additional peripherial:
   -sacrifice the UART and use Pin3/Port B4
   -sacrifice some volume and connect one side of the speaker to ground (or VCC) instead of Pin5/Port B0 or Pin6/Port B1 and use this. Set Bit COM1Ax in TCCR1 accordingly

*adjust volume by setting OCR1A to something different than OCR1C/2. perhaps even a second ultrasound modul can be used as input?
